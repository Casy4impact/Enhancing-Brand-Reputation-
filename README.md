# Project Implementation
At first, I created database with the name CREATE DATABASE AfriTechDB;
Thereafter, I created a temporary table with the name stagingdata.
-- Verify the Imported Data: SELECT * FROM stagingdata LIMIT 10;
-- -- Check Data Integrity:
-- Check for null values
-- Verify specific column data types

I created 3 tables from the temporary table and these tables include:
1.	Customerdata
2.	Transactions
3.	SocialMediaInteractions

### Multiple tables were created from the temporary table to promote the following:
1.	Data Organization and Structure
2.	Normalization (Reduce data duplication, ensure data integrity and Improve database efficiency)
3.	Data Integrity and Consistency
4.	Performance Optimization
5.	Flexibility and Scalability
-- Insert data from Stagingdata into the Target Tables (Customerdata, Transactions and SocialMediaInteractions) 

### DROP TABLE stagingdata: 
This table is no longer needed as I have created three important tables which was used foe the project.

## Data Validation
1.	Customerdata table has 200 rows, no missing values
2.	Socialmediainteractions table has 73,586 rows
3.	Crisiseventtime column in Socialmediainteractions table have 60,203 null values
4.	Firstresponsetime column in Socialmediainteractions table have 60,203 null values
5.	Resolutionstatus column in in Socialmediainteractions table has 60,203 null values
6.	Transactions table has 147,172 rows
7.	competitor column in Transactions table has 35,622 null values
Note: only columns with null values are written out for emphasis

## Action taken
I keep the columns with null values and proceed with the dataset as is, without dropping or modifying these columns, due to several key reasons:
1.	Preserving Data Completeness and Context
2.	Reflecting Real-World Data Conditions
3.	Exploring Imputation or Advanced Analytical Techniques
4.	Focusing on Specific Analysis Goals
5.	Avoiding Data Loss
6.	Exploring Causation or Correlation
7.	Null Values Represent Meaningful Information: For instance, null values in the "CrisisEventTime" column could indicate that no crisis event occurred. If the context implies that the nulls have a specific, meaningful interpretation, overlooking them might be appropriate.
